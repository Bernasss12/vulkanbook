# Table of Contents

The book is structured in the following chapters:

- [Chapter 00](chapter-00/chapter-00.md): Vulkan introduction and book pre-requisites.
- [Chapter 01](chapter-01/chapter-01.md): Describes the basic scaffolding code to support rendering.
- [Chapter 02](chapter-02/chapter-02.md): We start with the first Vulkan pieces of code that will create a Vulkan instance.
- [Chapter 03](chapter-03/chapter-03.md): We continue with the definition of more basic Vulkan concepts such as the physical and Logical devices, surfaces and queues.
- [Chapter 04](chapter-04/chapter-04.md): The key mechanism to present images to the screen is presented: the Swap chain.
- [Chapter 05](chapter-05/chapter-05.md): In this chapter we will setup the basic structures for rendering (render passes, command buffers and the synchronization mechanisms). 
- [Chapter 06](chapter-05/chapter-06.md): In this chapter we define the classes required to define the vertices, use the graphics pipeline and create shaders. We will draw our first shape to the screen (a triangle).
